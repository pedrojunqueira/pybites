# Platform Dependencies

If you want to work locally on our Bites use:

1. [requirements.txt](https://github.com/pybites/platform-dependencies/blob/master/requirements.txt) for a [regular Python 3.8 virtual environment](https://pybit.es/the-beauty-of-virtualenv.html) (note that this excludes `MutPy==0.6.1` because Test Bites still use Python 3.7 at this time!) 

2. [environment.yml](https://github.com/pybites/platform-dependencies/blob/master/environment.yml) for Anaconda / `conda` (check out [Martin's workflow article](https://pybit.es/guest-anaconda-workflow.html) for more info).
